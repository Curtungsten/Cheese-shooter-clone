This is my first attempt at CADding a turreted shooter for FRC. It's heavily inspired by team 254's shooter. I made mine based on pictures and info that I found. 
It has one set of indexer wheels driven by a KrakenX60 motor, and 4 sets of shooter rollers powered by 2 KrakenX60s. The entire shooter can also pivot on a sector gear also powered by a Kraken.
There is a limelight for vision so the shooter can track apriltags and aim at them.
